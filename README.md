# FPS in browser - Enemy Chasing Camera
Here is an example of how to place a 3D Object to always chase the camera position, as well as always "look" at the camera position. For FPS controls I used the PointerLockControls property from THREE.JS. Hope this helps anyone who has a question about FPS controls or still doesn't know how to make an element follow the camera. Soon new updates.
## Enjoy! :+1:
